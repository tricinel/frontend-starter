# Contributing

**First off: thanks! Open source software (and thus all software) exists because of people like you. <3**

## Filing issues

Please [check the existing issues](https://github.com/tricinel/frontend-starter/issues) to make sure your issue hasn't already been filed.

If you have a bug to report, please file it.

If you'd like to see a feature implemented, you can file an issue, but help is always appreciated.

If you'd like to contribute to the config, it's as simple as opening a pull request on GitHub for this repo. After that, I will code review your work and either ask you to fix any errors or merge the code into master. Here are a few tips to ensure the process goes smoothly:

- If you make substantial changes to the rules, consider adding a test case
- Do your work in a feature branch in order to keep things clean and easy
- Run `yarn lint` and `yarn test` before you commit
